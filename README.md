# 🦋 Flutter Rive Animation Project

## ✨ Brief Description of Functionalities
This project showcases a smooth and interactive Flutter application that integrates advanced **Rive animations**.  
The main functionalities include:
- 🎬 Real-time animation control using **State Machines**
- ⚡ Dynamic transitions between animation states
- 🖱️ User interaction triggers (e.g., tap, hover, or button press)
- 💡 Seamless integration of Rive `.riv` assets within Flutter’s widget tree

## 🎨 What is Rive?
**Rive** is a powerful design and animation tool that allows developers and designers to create interactive vector animations that run in real time.  
Unlike traditional animations, **Rive files** can respond to user inputs and logic, making them perfect for modern apps and games.

> 🧠 Think of it as “Lottie on steroids” — interactive, customizable, and super efficient for cross-platform apps.

## ⚙️ What is a State Machine in Rive?
A **State Machine** in Rive defines how animations behave and transition based on user input or logic from your app.  
For example:
- When the user taps a button → the animation switches from “Idle” to “Active”.
- When a variable changes in Flutter → Rive reacts automatically.

In simple terms, it’s the **brain** controlling animation logic inside your `.riv` file 🧩
